# Cybersecurity Risk Matrix

This project demonstrates how cybersecurity controls (e.g., from NIST 800-53) can be programmatically sorted and evaluated by risk level using a simple Python script and JSON input.

## Files

- `sample_controls.json`: Sample data representing security controls and their associated risk levels.
- `controls_map.py`: Script to parse and group controls by risk level.

## How to Run

```bash
python controls_map.py
```

## Use Case

This could be extended into:
- Risk dashboards
- GRC scoring tools
- Compliance checklists tied to business functions# Cybersecurity_Risk_Matrix
